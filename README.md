# SatConstellationDC

Implementation of the paper "Passivity-based distributed acquisition and station-keeping control of a satellite constellation in areostationary orbit" by Sin, Yin and Arcak. The paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12214). Both a continuous model as well as a hybrid model is available, with the hybrid model simulating communication links as discrete events in time.
